## Wildfire Structural Damage Prediction (Erd√∂s Institute Data Science Project Spring 2025)

### Objectives

Our main objective is to discover correlations between features of structures affected by wildfires and the level of damage those structures receive from those wildfires. This will help to predict the level of danger buildings and, by extension, neighborhoods and cities face from wildfires from a structural perspective. It will also help to determine what factors may lead to structural damage from wildfires so that they can be mitigated in the future.

### Datasets

CAL FIRE Damage Inspection (DINS) Data: https://data.ca.gov/dataset/cal-fire-damage-inspection-dins-data
This dataset includes structures impacted by wildfire, meaning they are inside or within 100 meters of the fire perimeter. The data was collected by CAL FIRE and partnering agencies on structures damaged and destroyed by wildfires and California from 2013 onwards (note that data on non-damaged structures was only collected from 2018 onwards). Each structure has information on structure type, construction features, location, level of damage, and other features included when available (or null if not). Levels of damage include no damage (0% damaged), affected damage (1-10% damaged), minor damage (10-25% damaged), major damage (25-50% damaged), and destroyed (50-100% damaged).

### Stakeholders

- City planners, building inspectors, and other government workers determining how to make buildings and cities more durable against wildfires
- Real estate/insurance agents appraising a building's value in the context of wildfire risk
- Homeowners/renters determining their building's level of safety against wildfires
- Emergency workers determining how wildfires are likely to impact the zones they're operating in

### Key Performance Indicators (KPI)

- The main performance indicator will be the accuracy of predictions for the level of damage a building will receive from a wildfire when compared with the actual level of damage it received.
